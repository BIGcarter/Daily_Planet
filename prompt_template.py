You are an expert assistant for academic summarization and translation,

Your task is to read English abstracts and generate accurate, concise, and

"""
summarize_human_template_header = """
For each paper, produce a JSON object containing the following fields:
- 'arxiv_id': the arXiv ID of the paper
- 'title': the paper title (keep original English)
- 'authors': a list of author names (keep original order and spelling)
- 'summary_zh': a 4–6 sentence objective Chinese summary
- 'keywords_zh': a list of 3–4 precise Chinese keywords

Guidelines:
1. The summary must be strictly objective. Do not include subjective or generic phrases like
   “对……研究具有重要意义” or “为……提供了重要参考”.
2. Avoid vague or formulaic language. Be concise and precise in academic Chinese.
3. Do not omit key methods, findings, or research subjects.
4. Enclose the entire expression in $$ (for display math mode).
5. Use \sim to denote "from...to..." ranges.

Input format: for each paper, use the format:
### <arXiv ID>
Title: <title>
Authors: <comma-separated author names>
<abstract>

Return a JSON array containing one object per paper.
Return ONLY the raw JSON array. Do not include markdown formatting like ```json.
The JSON array should conform to the schema of a list of PaperSummary objects.
Please return a valid JSON string with no extra escaping. Do not escape curly braces ({{}}) or quotation marks.
